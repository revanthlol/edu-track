## üöÄ Getting Started: Local Development

Follow these steps precisely to get the project running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**
-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   A running local instance of MySQL

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd edu-track-project
```

### **2. Setup the Backend**

First, navigate to the backend directory and install all required dependencies.
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Next, create the environment file.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open the `.env` file and populate it with your local MySQL database credentials and a JWT secret.

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting the server, you must seed the database. This command will create all tables and populate them with sample data, including the default login accounts.
```bash
npm run seed
```

Now, you can start the backend server.
```bash
npm run dev
```
The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:3001`.

### **3. Setup the Frontend**

In a **new, separate terminal**, navigate to the frontend directory and install its dependencies.
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Now, start the frontend development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at **`http://localhost:5173`**.
